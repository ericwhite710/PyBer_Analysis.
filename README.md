# PyBer_Analysis.

## Overview
 Using Python and Pandas create a vizualization of the total fares by city type.  
With this we can break down the three city types the different gross outcomes and what the averages everyone pays because of it. Next we can compare how a rural system has its advantages and disadvantages against its counterpart of a busy city.

## Results
 Compiled into a graph we have the totals and averages by city types. Key factors is we can determine the distribution of equipement based on amount used in each city category.
and in each niche we breakdown how many people use a fare and if it is worth it to maintain rides or keep up with what is bringing in the most or do we need more fare rides etc.
 Rural has the least amount of rides drivers and fares meaning the averages and the fare per driver are going to be more expensive to keep up and mantain those areas. Whereas since more people are using it in urban areas the cost is less per ride but also has more total rides drivers and fares.

Showing if more people ride then the cost is going to be less the takeaway from this is that the experience might be less convenient because the demand of rides wearing down equipment and the type of persons using it.
The gross total fares from the Urban area is $39,854 compared to suburbans $19,356 and rurals 4,327. a great incremental gross across the chart and we can see why urban might need to be maintained or impliment more fares/ drivers to componsate for the demand of fares. Another argument might be that even with so little demand for a fare in the rural areas lowering the price from said $55.49 to $39.50, could entice more people to ride a fare.
we can see in the initial 5 months of this graph that we had a peak performance out of all three city types around end of February to March and whereas at April the charts are scattered. The time in the graph shows one season and based on that it is used throughout the year and has a steady flow of income to use ratio.

## Summary
Three recommendations to try would be maintaining the urban equipment more than the rural. This general upkeep can improve the customer experience and choose your fares over competitors. Also see if implementing more fares in the urban cities is beneficial seeing it is being used constantly year round. Then a third option is lower the cost of the rural fares to see if it positively increases fare usage.
