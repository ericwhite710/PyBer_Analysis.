Module 5 PyBer Analysis
Multiple line grpah that shows total weekly fares for each city type
why this is important is several factors including distribution of equipment to the type of location for rural urban and suburban types
and in each niche we breakdown how many people use a fare and if it is worth it to maintain rides or keep up with what is bringing in the most or do we need more fare rides etc.

summary by city type

Using Python and Pandas create a vizualization of the total fares by city type.  
Breaking down how by the three city types that we gross different outcomes and what the averages evryone pays because of it
we also compare how a rural system has its advatages and disadvantages agains its counterparts


we counted the totals for rides drivers and fares
we averaged fare per ride and fare per driver

rural has the least amount of rides drivers and fares meaning the averages and the fare per driver are going to be more expensive to keep up and amintain those areas
were as since more people are using it in urban areas the cost is less per ride but also has more total rides drivers and fares

showing if more people ride then the cost is going to be less the takeaway fro mthis is that the experience might less convinient because the demand of rides wearing dow n equipment and the type of persons using it
The gross total fares from the Urban area is $39,854 compared to suburbans $19,356 and rurals 4,327. a good gross across the chart and we can see why urban might need to be maintained or impliment more fares/ drivers to componsate for the demand of fares
another argument might be that even with so little demand for a fare in the rural areas lowering the price from said $55.49 to $39.50, could entice more people to ride a fare.
we can see in the initail 5 months of this graph that we had a peak performance out of all three city types around end of February to March and whereas at april the charts are scattered

three recommendations to try would be 
maintaining the urban equipment more than the rural
also see if implementing more fares in the urban cities is beneficial 
and lower the cost of the rural fares to see if it positively increases fare usage
